			<br>
			<span style="font-weight: 300; display: inline-block; width: 770px;">
				Welcome to the redesigned Netcade! As you are likely aware, the old version of Netcade was bloc‎ked a while ago and you should have had the bookmark to use the website during this time. Over the past month or so though I have been working on a redesign of the site and it's now live! Before I go through the full changelog, I want to say a massive thank you to everyone who's been using the site. It's spread pretty far across our year group and also other year groups actually, and even across another school in the UK. &lt;3<br><br>
